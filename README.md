# ironclad-clan-goals
A tracker to allow participants to contribute towards Ironclad clan goals.

Looking to join? Checkout our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gZRxMMjP).

## What is tracked?
1. The account hash (unique identifier) and character name of the active account
   2. Why? We discourage the use of non-ironman alt accounts so this is used to remove any contributions towards a goal for those accounts.
2. Whenever experience is gained: what skill and new total experience in that skill
   3. Why? 'Cause that's the whole point of the plugin â€“ tracking experience towards a shared goal.
